## Introduction

SwapStyle Hub integrates social media functionalities, user-generated content, and sustainable fashion options into a single shopping platform. This project is designed to provide an affordable and environmentally friendly fashion experience while fostering a vibrant community of fashion enthusiasts.

## Use Cases

### 1. Social Shopping Integration
Integrate social media functionalities and user-generated content, such as influencer collaborations, customer reviews, and shoppable posts, to create an interactive and immersive shopping experience. This resonates with fast fashion enthusiasts, positioning SwapStyle Hub as the go-to destination, driving customer growth and conversion.

### 2. Engagement on a Shopping Platform
Build engagement constructs on the platform that drive connectivity and virality among younger audiences. These constructs do not need to be linked to shopping but should be linked to fashion, driving users to habitually visit the app.

## Problem Statement

1. **Lack of Access to Affordable Fashion:** Many individuals, especially Gen Z, struggle to find stylish, affordable clothing.
2. **Environmental Impact of Fast Fashion:** Fast fashion significantly contributes to environmental degradation due to high production waste and pollution.
3. **Underutilized Clothing:** Many wardrobes contain items that are rarely worn, leading to waste.
4. **Limited Social Interaction in Thrift Shopping:** Current thrift shopping lacks a social component that allows for community engagement and inspiration.

## Solution Proposed

### 1. Social Media Integration
- **Activity Feed:** Engage users by displaying thrift finds, styling tips, and wishlist items.
- **Engagement Tools:** Enhance interaction with like, comment, and share options.

### 2. Profile Integration
- **User Profiles:** Allow users to showcase their style, thrifted items, and wishlist.
- **Followers and Following:** Build a community by enabling users to follow friends and influencers.

### 3. Thrift Integration
- **Marketplace:** Facilitate buying, selling, and swapping of thrifted items with advanced search and filter options.
- **In-App Messaging:** Enhance communication for negotiations and inquiries.

### 4. Dashboard (Challenges and Rewards)
- **Fashion Challenges:** Organize theme-based competitions with community voting.
- **Sustainability Score:** Reward users for sustainable purchases and highlight their impact.
- **Rewards System:** Offer points and redeemable rewards for participation and sustainable actions.
